# Syntaxit

This project is a java bot that when configured properly will configurate cisco devices (Routers and Switches).
All the configurations available are up to a CCNA 2 complexity.

This was tested only in Packet Tracer. The bot will simulate pressing the keyboard's keys, and the operator must guide him
to the correct console, whether it is a SSH or a packet tracer virtual console.

See the file devices.desc to understand how to configure this thing.
